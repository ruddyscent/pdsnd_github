### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis

### Description
This project analyzes bike share data from three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It provides statistical insights into the most popular times of travel, the most popular stations, trip duration, and user information based on the data provided. The analysis is performed by the `bikeshare_2.py` script, which processes the data and outputs the findings in a user-friendly manner.

### Files used

### Credits
The project was inspired by the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program. Additional insights were obtained from Stack Overflow for data manipulation techniques. Special thanks to the contributors of pandas and numpy libraries for making data analysis easier.
